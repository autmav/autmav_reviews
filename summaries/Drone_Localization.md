# Drone Localization Literature Reviews

The purpose is to review the papers focusing on localization of drones in a limited indoor environment. The works to be reviewd must use camera sensors as exterior sensors. They may also the interior IMU sensors mounted on the flying robots to fuse them with the camera data in the localization algorithm.

Answer to the following questions in your reviews:

1. How many cameras are used externally?

2. Is IMU sensor used?

3. How is the object detected? Explain the whole computer vision scheme.

3. Explain the posotioning algorithm *exactly*

4. What sensor fusion paradigms are followed (if it's been)?

5. Is the object's motion model encountered in the algorithm? How?

6. How many drones are localized? Is the algorithm able to localize more than one object?

7. What is the speed limit for the moving robots in the implementation?

8. Explain the implementation platform.

9.
