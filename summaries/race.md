*title:* RAPTOR: Robust and perception aware trajectory replanning for quadrotor fast flight
**Review:** (3-B-1-91) / Constrain the trajectory to stay close to the found path.

**Abstract-2:** Recent advances in trajectory replanning have enabled quadrotor to navigate autonomously in unknown environments. However,high-speed navigation still remains a significant challenge. Given very limited time, existing methods have no strong guarantee on the feasibility or quality of the solutions. Moreover, most methods do not consider environment perception, which is the key bottleneck to fast flight. In this paper, They present RAPTOR, a robust and perception-aware replanning framework to support fast and safe flight, which addresses these issues systematical

In addition, completely unknown payloads can be introduced to the system, with minimal degradation in tracking performance.

Although the velocities achieved by the MPCC controller were lower than that of [124] and [125], the lap times for the same race track were actually lower due to the ability of the controller to find a new time allocation that takes into account the current state of the platform at every timestep. The work is further extended to solve the time-allocation problem online, and to replan online [104] while also controlling near the limit of the flight system.

*title:* **Lyapunov-stable neural-network control**

*year:* 2021

**Review**: Model-based classic control (4-C-174) / With a learning-based controller, it can be difficult to provide robustness guarantees as with traditional methods such as the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). While a learning-based controller may provide superior performance to classical methods in simulation, it may be that they cannot be used in the real world due to the inability to provide an analysis of the controllerâ€™s stability properties. This is particularly problematic for tracking the time-optimal trajectories required by drone racing. Recent works have attempted to address this using the Lyapunov-stable neural network design for the control of quadrotors [174]. This work shows that it is possible to have a learning-based controller with guarantees that can also outperform classical LQR methods.
