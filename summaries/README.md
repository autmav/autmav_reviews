Each research field (which can be subjected to a specific research project) is summarized in a separate markdown file. In each file, the papers are categorized in different topics in order to better classification. As your wish, add the state-of-the-art works or remove redundant ones.

For the currently listed papers, there are empty fields. Based on the paper title, find the data and aomplete the information.

*IPORTANT NOTE:* This document is created to summarize the research work! Try to give the explanation, *AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE!*. Writing more than a half-page of paper for each article makes the resulting summary too long.

For each paper, first add the paper name as the heading. Add the following data:

- Link to the paper

- Link to the source code (github, etc.)

- Author(s)

- Publication (or Acceptance) data

- Journal or Conference (along with the scientific rank of a journal)

Be careful that your review is included under the relevant title.

The questions listed for each topic to be answered, are not necessarily fixed. These questions are designed to better categorize the articles. If necessary, add, remove or change the questions.
