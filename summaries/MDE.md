This is a set of brief reviews in the **Monocular Depth Estimation** area on most recent research papers in the filed. 

Monocular Depth Estimation is the task of estimating the depth value (distance relative to the camera) of each pixel given a single (monocular) RGB image. This challenging task is a key prerequisite for determining scene understanding for applications such as 3D scene reconstruction, autonomous driving, and AR.


For each paper, first add the paper name as the heading. Add the following data:

- Author(s)

- Publication (or Acceptance) data

- Journal or Conference (along with the scientific rank of a journal)

Be careful that your review is included under the relevant title.
