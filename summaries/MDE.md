# Monocular Depth Estimation Literature Reviews

This is a set of brief reviews in the **Monocular Depth Estimation** area on most recent research papers in the filed. 

Monocular Depth Estimation is the task of estimating the depth value (distance relative to the camera) of each pixel given a single (monocular) RGB image. This challenging task is a key prerequisite for determining scene understanding for applications such as 3D scene reconstruction, autonomous driving, and AR.

Type a paragraph

#### Answers:

1. **Outline:** A) They design and implement a semantic and deep fusion convolutional neural network (SDFCNN), which can perform semantic segmentation and depth estimation simultaneously by inferring input color RGB images. It greatly reduces the number of parameters, computation and time required for inferring the two network models.
B) They propose the feature point and feature description convolutional neural network (FPFDCNN) for feature point extraction from two different frames of images and generate vectors as descriptors for each feature point. FPFDCNN adopts the pixel shuffle algorithm to carry out superpixel restoration on low-resolution images. Using FPFDCNN can significantly reduce the environmental impact and finally generate high-resolution images.
C) They also add a data correction module to optimize a point cloud map globally to establish a consistent point cloud map and to greatly reduce the inference time and network parameters.

2. They construct a semantic and depth fusion SLAM (SDF-SLAM) framework, which fuses camera pose information and depth and semantic information of each frame.

3. They propose a CNN named FPFDCNN for feature point extraction. The FPFDCNN model consists of five components, including input layer, encoder layers, decoder layers, output layers and concatenate layer. FPFDCNN network structure:

![FPFDCNN network structure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106483656/185100051-5b8fbe59-695f-4bab-b486-df10a08d4686.jpg)

4. **Results:** The average accuracy of the predicted point cloud coordinates reaches 90%, and the average accuracy of the semantic labels reaches 67%. Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-artSLAMframeworks, such as ORB-SLAM, LSD-SLAM, and CNN-SLAM, the absolute error of the camera trajectory on indoor data with more feature points is reduced from 0.436 m, 0.495 m, and 0.243 m to 0.037 m, respectively. On indoor data with fewer feature points, they decrease from 1.826 m, 1.206 m, and 0.264 m to 0.124 m, respectively.
The camera pose obtained by SDF-SLAM, which extracts feature points through a CNN, is more accurate than that obtained by ORB-SLAM.

5. **SDF-SLAM experimental platform:**

6. No its not.

7. **Ideas:** Currently, the state-of-art methods use feature point matching to estimate camera pose based on the PnP method.

8. **Datasets:** They select the rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_desk2 (f1_desk2) scene from the TUM dataset for feature point extraction named FP dataset.

9. **SDF-SLAM architecture:**

10. **3-Dimensional semantic map's steps:** (1) Design a deep semantic fusion CNN to complete the two tasks of image depth estimation and semantic segmentation. (2) Fuse the depth information and semantic information into 3D semantic point cloud data. (3) Map the point cloud data of each frame to the world coordinate system according to the camera pose to obtain a 3D semantic map.

### M4Depth: Monocular depth estimation for autonomous vehicles in unseen environments

[Link to the Paper]()

[Link to the Source Code](https://github.com/michael-fonder/M4Depth)

**Authors:** 
MichaÃ«l Fonder, Damien Ernst, and Marc Van Droogenbroeck

**Date:**

**Journal or Conference:** 

#### Answers:
1. Outline: 1) They extend the notion of visual disparity to camera baselines featuring six degrees of freedom (6 DoF) transformations, and present customized cost volumes for this disparity. 2) They present a novel real-time and lightweight multi-level architecture based on these cost volumes to perform end to end depth estimation on video streams acquired in unstructured environments. 3) It is shown that M4Depth, is state of the art on the Mid-Air dataset, that it has good performances on the KITTI dataset, that it outperforms existing methods in a generalization setup on the TartanAir dataset.

2. Sensor fusion is not used. Just visual. Pseudo sensor: MDE

3. Architecture overview of M4Depth (with three levels here):

![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106483656/184727447-435cab8f-1e5d-4f4c-9f9f-17404997a0c1.jpg)

It is fed by two consecutive frames and the camera motion. Each disparity refiner produces a disparity estimate and learnable disparity features. All convolutions are followed by a leaky ReLU activation unit, except for the ones producing a disparity estimate. To ease the convergence, disparities are encoded in the log-space.
They use these new cost volumes(the Disparity Sweeping Cost Volume (DSCV) and the Spatial Neighborhood Cost Volume (SNCV) ) to leverage the visual spatio-temporal constraints imposed by motion and to make the network robust for varied scenes.

4. Performance metrics are taken from Eigen et al. for depth maps limited to 80 m.
This network has 4.5 million parameters and requires up to 500 MB of GPU memory to run with six levels. At inference time on Mid-Air, an NVidia Tesla V100 GPU needs 17 ms to process a single frame for a raw TensorFlow implementation. This corresponds to 59 fps which is roughly twenty-times faster than DeepV2D, the best performing method on KITTI. Such inference speed is compatible with the real-time constraints required for robotic applications.

5.  In order to compare their method with its parent, PWC-Net, they perform the same experiments for both M4Depth and PWC-Net.
They present three experiments: 
A) They compare the performance of their method with the ones of the state of the art on a dataset featuring unstructured environments, using Mid-Air dataset.
B) They assess the performance on a standard depth estimation using KITTI dataset.
C) They evaluate the generalization capabilities of all the methods. They use static scenes that are semantically close to either the Mid-Air or the KITTI dataset, and test the performance of the method trained on Mid-Air (respectively KITTI) on the selected unstructured (respectively urban) scenes without any fine-tuning. For this experiment, they use TartanAir dataset.

6. No, its not.

7. **Future works:** Their further works on M4Depth will, among others, focus on the determination of its own uncertainty on depth estimates at inference time. Such an addition would provide a great advantage over other methods that do not offer this capability.

8. **Performance:** Their network outperforms the state of the art on these datasets. M4Depth is superior to the baseline both in unstructured environments and in generalization while also performing well on the standard KITTI benchmark, which shows its superiority for autonomous vehicles. In addition to being motion- and featureinvariant, their method is lightweight, runs in real time, and can be trained in an end-to-end fashion.

### Bayesian cue integration of structure from motion and CNNâbased monocular depth estimation for autonomous robot navigation

#### Review:

They exploit structure from motion (SfM) through optical flow as an additional depth cue and prior knowledge about depth distribution in the environment to improve monocular depth prediction to enable robot navigation in an unstructured, hitherto unfamiliar environment.. They show how it is possible to promote MDE cue from ordinal scale to the same metric scale as SfM, thus, enabling their optimal integration in a Bayesian optimal manner.

#### Answers:

1. **Overall workflow:**

![Workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106483656/185744336-02035a7a-6492-4937-8f8f-e5c3010e41fc.jpg)

2. The captured frame is processed using the MDE and SfM models described, and together with the speed and pose information, depth fusion is performed. Also sensory cues from MDE and SfM are fused to reduce the resulting variance (standard deviation).
Sensor fusion algorythm: optimized scaling adaptive Kalman Filter (osAKF)
Sensor/Pseudo sensors: IMU + Camera + Lidar(for prior experiments) + Odometry + CNNâbased MDE + SfM 

3. **Proposed Network Architecture:**

![Untitled2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106483656/185747128-da6aa709-c7ed-4e4f-9452-06cc74a48841.jpg)

The neural network architecture proposed in this work is inspired by Alhashim and Wonka, whose CNN architecture consists of an encoder based on transfer learning, and a simple decoder. The feature extractor in the said work is a pretrained DenseNet-169 model using the ImageNet dataset. The encoder of their model is a custom network pre-trained on Kaggleâs Cats vs Dogs dataset. The network uses Max pooling and ReLU activations throughout.
The network uses a weighted combination of four lossesâmean absolute depth error (ADE), the scale-invariant (S-I) function proposed by Lee et al. , image gradient (IG) loss and structural similarity (SSIM) loss function for training. We used ADE, S-I and IG functions as defined in Alhashim and Wonka.
The architecture greatly reduces model complexity and ensures efficiency.

4. The data rates for pose and speed information are 200 Hz and 100 Hz, respectively.

5. 
* Sensor models (likelihoods of MDE and SfM sensor model) and prior are determined.
* They built a model representing this relationship by first running a series of experiments for various combinations of MDE predicted depth, versus actual scene depths corresponding to various camera tilt angles only for corresponding image regions. (from 0 to 45Â° and 0 to - 45Â° with increments of 5Â°. It is limited to 45Â° since larger angles produce too narrow spatial overlap). As the relative tilt between two frames increases, the overlapping region of their field of views decreases.
* two conditions were of interestâthe ability to perceive depth accurately with (a) normal camera pose and (b) camera subjected to angular tilts.

**Training:** Training of the network is performed in two stages, as illustrated in Algorithm 1. The weights for the part of the encoder based on pretrained Cats vs Dogs classifier are frozen during the first round of training (i.e., when weight update mode is âpartialâ). Meanwhile, the weights for the second part of encoder, as well as the decoder, are initialized using *He Normal* distributions. In the second round of trainingâwhen weight update mode is âall layersââall network weights are updated.

6. No it's not. It is *Robust Autonomous Indoor Navigation robot (RAINav)*; a custom-built mini vehicle system with a camera in the front face of the vehicle and four motors interfaced with OMRON E6B2-CWZ6C high-accuracy rotary encoders. 

**Major components of the robot:** 1âJetson TX2; 2âArm Cortex M4 microcontroller system; 3âCamera; 4âLiDAR (only used for sampling prior depth values) 

7. **Future works:** Future work could incorporate object recognition as well as size and rigidity estimation pipelines to distinguish objects that should be avoided, from small or deformable ones on the robotâs path that could be trampled on.

8. **Performance:** They have been able to improve depth estimation accuracy by more than 6% in a mobile robot navigation setting where the robotâs heading can under large angular inclinations.
Experimental results show that besides providing metric scale for dense depth map, the integration of these cues significantly improves depth accuracy, reliability and robustness beyond what could be obtained from monocular vision or structure from motion alone.

#### Review:

They introduce a novel self-supervised deep learning-based VIO and depth map recovery approach (SelfVIO) using adversarial training and self-adaptive visual-inertial sensor fusion.
* No strict temporal or spatial calibration between camera and IMU is necessary for pose and depth estimation, contrary to traditional VO approaches.
* To the best of their knowledge, this is the first selfsupervised deep joint monocular VIO and depth reconstruction method in the literature.

#### Answers:

1. **Architecture overview:**

![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106483656/185489464-606c325d-2f64-4e0f-9d7c-59f99e1823d3.jpg)

Unlabeled image sequences and raw IMU measurements are provided as inputs to the network. The method estimates relative translation and rotation between consecutive frames parametrized as 6-DoF motion and a depth image as a disparity map for a given view.

2. They propose a novel unsupervised sensor fusion technique for the camera and the IMU, which extracts and fuses motion features from raw IMU measurements and RGB camera images using convolutional and recurrent modules based on an attention mechanism.
