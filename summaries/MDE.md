# Monocular Depth Estimation Literature Reviews

This is a set of brief reviews in the **Monocular Depth Estimation** area on most recent research papers in the filed. 

Monocular Depth Estimation is the task of estimating the depth value (distance relative to the camera) of each pixel given a single (monocular) RGB image. This challenging task is a key prerequisite for determining scene understanding for applications such as 3D scene reconstruction, autonomous driving, and AR.


For each paper, first add the paper name as the heading. Add the following data:

- Author(s)

- Publication (or Acceptance) data

- Journal or Conference (along with the scientific rank of a journal)

Be careful that your review is included under the relevant title.


## Pure MDE

Here, summarize the investigations in the new useful MDE softwares which are included in a research project. I mean they have the both open-source code and the paper.

After presenting the aforementioned data about each paper, answer to the following questions in your review:

- Explain an outline of the method

- Describe the performance in terms of depth estimation quality, FPS, etc. such that makes it comparable with the rest of the similar works



## MDE for SLAM

Here, talk about the research projects which their output was a SLAM base-on, or aided-by the MDE.
In your review, answer to the following questions:

- Explain an outline of the method

- Is there any sensor fusion or data fusion? What are the sensors

- If used, how was the neural network architecture?

- Give a criteria of the calculational ability (FPS in terms of processor)

- In what range of cases, and how, is the system implemented

- Is the system based on a flying robot platform? If yes, what was the platform? How was the implementation? What were the mission and mission specifications?



## MDE for Object tracking
